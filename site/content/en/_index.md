# `KWOK` (`K`ubernetes `W`ith`O`ut `K`ubelet)

<img align="right" width="180px" src="/favicon.svg">

[KWOK] is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

## What is KWOK?

KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools:

- `kwok` is the cornerstone of this project, responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.
- `kwokctl` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by `kwok`.

## Getting Started

The following examples are tested to work with the latest version of `kwok`/`kwokctl`.

### Basic Usage

- [`kwok` Manages Nodes and Pods]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-manage-nodes-and-pods" >}}) - Basic operations of `kwok` to manage Nodes and Pods
- `kwok` - maintain Nodes heartbeat and Pods status.
    - [`kwok` in Cluster]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-in-cluster" >}}) - Installing `kwok` in a cluster
    - [`kwok` in Local]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-in-local" >}}) - Run `kwok` in the local for a cluster
- `kwokctl` - cluster creation, etcd snapshot, etc.
    - [`kwokctl` Manages Clusters]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwokctl-manage-cluster" >}}) - Create/Delete a cluster in local where all nodes are managed by `kwok`
    - [`kwokctl` Snapshots Cluster]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwokctl-snapshot" >}}) - Save/Restore the Etcd data of a cluster created by `kwokctl`

## `kwokctl` Runtime and OS Support

Runtime indicates which medium `kwokctl` will use to start the cluster

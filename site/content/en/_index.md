# `KWOK` (`K`ubernetes `W`ith`O`ut `K`ubelet)

<img align="right" width="180px" src="/favicon.svg">

[kwok](https://sigs.k8s.io/kwok) is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employes
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

So far we provide two tools:

- **Kwok:** Core of this repo. It simulates thousands of fake Nodes.
- **Kwokctl:** A CLI to facilitate creating and managing clusters simulated by Kwok.

## Getting Started

The following examples are tested to work with the latest version of Kwok/Kwokctl.

### Basic Usage

- [Kwok Manage Nodes and Pods]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-manage-nodes-and-pods" >}}) - Kwok's basic management of Node and Pod operations
- Kwok - maintain Nodes heartbeat and Pods status.
    - [Kwok in Cluster]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-in-cluster" >}}) - Installing Kwok in a cluster
    - [Kwok in Local]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-in-local" >}}) - Run Kwok in the local for a cluster
- Kwokctl - cluster creation, etcd snapshot, etc.
    - [Kwokctl Manage Clusters]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwokctl-manage-cluster" >}}) - Create/Delete a cluster in local where all nodes are managed by Kwok
    - [Kwokctl Snapshot Cluster]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwokctl-snapshot" >}}) - Save/Restore the Etcd data of a cluster created by Kwokctl

## Kwokctl Runtime and OS Support

Runtime indicates which medium kwokctl will use to start the cluster
